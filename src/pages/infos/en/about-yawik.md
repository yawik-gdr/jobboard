# About Yawik

Yawik provides several tools based on [Quasar](https://quasar.dev). The componte Framework allows us to develop much faster than [before](https:old.yawik.org). At the core

Good software developers don't have a hard time finding a new job. The really good ones don't have to search job boards. Some don't want to, because a job ad doesn't correspond to what they are looking for.

It's not just job boards that have a hard time finding good developers.

Job boards spend a lot of time matching employers with job seekers. They get paid for their work. And their work is important. But there is a lot of room to improve efficiency.

And then there are the good developers around Quasar. The framework that gives the Yawik project the speed to develop the tools that HR needs.
