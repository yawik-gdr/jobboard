# About us
What is the Yawik Jobboard? And what is Yawik, the software we use? In addition, on this page we introduce the people behind the 
Yawik Jobboard. 

## About Yawik Jobboard
The Yawik Jobboard is a job board, but a special one. As with other portals, job ads can be created and vacancies can be searched for. Those looking for a new job can limit the selection to certain regions or industries. Open positions at large companies can also be searched for specifically. 
Nevertheless, there are some important differences to commercial competitors. The job advertisement on the Yawik Jobboard is free of charge. It can be easily and conveniently entered via a form and - if desired - then almost as easily integrated on one's own website. Another special feature: the Yawik Jobboard is based on the free software Yawik

## About Yawik
Yawik is to HR software what WordPress is to editorial systems: a free and flexible open source solution. It is not only the basis for the Yawik job portal, but can also be used for a company's own job board or career pages. Because of its open source character, the software can be easily adapted to your own needs. 
It is important to note that Yawik can easily be adapted to a company's design. The software offers a job advertisement and applicant management system (ATS), a CV database and a job portal. However, all components are modular, not all building blocks have to be used for every application. And because of its open source character, further components can also be developed and added. 
Job advertisements can also be published with Yawik via Google Jobs.

## Yawik functions
