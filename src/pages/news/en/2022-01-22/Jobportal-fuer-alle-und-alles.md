# A job portal for all and everything

There is now a job portal for everyone. Or better yet, for everything. It's not just for job seekers, as one commonly assumes the target group of a job portal is. 
It's not just for employers either. It is for everything and everyone. Because the job portal is open source. So it is also for all those who have always wanted to 
have a job portal. Who feel called to make sure that people find each other better.
