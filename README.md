# Yawik Jobboard

The Yawik Jobboard is a portal for job advertisements and serves as an example of a Quasar app that can be used as a job board. 

All job advertisements are "real". Posting ads is free of charge. All ads placed are manually checked and activated.

git clone git@gitlab.com:yawik/jobbord.git
cd jobboard
yarn

```

### Lint the files

```
to fix lint errors
